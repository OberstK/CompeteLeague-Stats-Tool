# CompeteLeague Stats Tool

## Description
A command line tool to gather and calculate specific stats from our RAW stats JSONs.
In the future this tool should be able to request the stats from our API and create a full folder package ready to use.
Maybe I will add a web view for this tool some time as well.

## How to use
1. Clone this repo and make sure you have NodeJS installed on your computer.
2. Make sure to edit the ``config.json`` to fit your requirements
3. start the script

        npm start
